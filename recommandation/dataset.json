        "description": "1984 or Nineteen Eighty-Four: A Novel, is a dystopian novel by English novelist George Orwell. It was published on 8 June 1949. 1984 is one of George Orwell's most powerful politically charged novels, a beautifully crafted warning against the dangers of a totalitarian society, and one of the most famous novels in the dystopian genre. Winston Smith is a low-ranking member of the ruling party in London whose every move is monitored by telescreens. Everywhere Winston goes, the party's omniscient leader, Big Brother, watches him. This is an important novel not only for its stark warning against abusive authority (and its somewhat ironic contribution to modern television content), but also for its insights into the power of manipulating language, history, and the psychology of fear and control. These issues are perhaps even more pertinent today than when Orwell penned his novel.",

George and his simple-minded friend Lenny dream, as drifters will, of a place to call their own\u2014a couple of acres and a few pigs, chickens, and rabbits back in Hill Country where land is cheap. But after they come to work on a ranch in the fertile Salinas Valley of California, their hopes, like \u201cthe best laid schemes o\u2019mice an\u2019 men,\u201d begin to go awry. Of Mice and Men also represents an experiment in form, as Steinbeck described his work, \u201ca kind of playable novel, written in novel form but so scened and set that it can be played as it stands.\u201d A rarity in American letters, it achieved remarkable success as a novel, a Broadway play, and three acclaimed films.",

This imaginative, powerful, and stylistically brilliant work not only brought the insights of Neo-Darwinism to a wide audience, but galvanized the biology community, generating much debate and stimulating whole new areas of research. Forty years later, its insights remain as relevant today as on the day it was published. This 40th anniversary edition includes a new epilogue from the author discussing the continuing relevance of these ideas in evolutionary biology today, as well as the original prefaces and foreword, and extracts from early reviews.

Mukherjee recounts centuries of discoveries, setbacks, victories, and deaths, told through the eyes of his predecessors and peers, training their wits against an infinitely resourceful adversary that, just three decades ago, was thought to be easily vanquished in an all-out \u201cwar against cancer.\u201d The book reads like a literary thriller with cancer as the protagonist.

Impossible but true, because Henry is one of the first people diagnosed with Chrono-Displacement Disorder: periodically his genetic clock resets and he finds himself misplaced in time, pulled to moments of emotional gravity in his life, past and future. His disappearances are spontaneous, his experiences unpredictable, alternately harrowing and amusing. The Time Traveler's Wife depicts the effects of time travel on Henry and Clare's marriage and their passionate love for each other as the story unfolds from both points of view. Clare and Henry attempt to live normal lives, pursuing familiar goals - steady jobs, good friends, children of their own. All of this is threatened by something they can neither prevent nor control, making their story intensely moving and entirely unforgettable.",

But his contentment is disturbed when the wizard, Gandalf, and a company of thirteen dwarves arrive on his doorstep one day to whisk him away on an unexpected journey \u2018there and back again.\u2019 They have a plot to raid the treasure hoard of Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon . . . Written for J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s own children, The Hobbit was published on 21 September 1937. With a beautiful cover design, a handful of black & white drawings and two maps by the author himself, the book became an instant success and was reprinted shortly afterwards with five color plates. Tolkien\u2019s own selection of finished paintings and drawings have become inseparable from his text, adorning editions of The Hobbit for more than 85 years. But the published art has afforded only a glimpse of Tolkien\u2019s creative process, and many additional sketches, colored drawings and maps \u2013 although exhibited and published elsewhere \u2013 have never appeared within the pages of The Hobbit. In this unique enhanced edition of Tolkien\u2019s enchanting classic tale, the full panoply of his art is reproduced for the first time, presenting more than 50 illustrations to accompany Bilbo Baggins on his adventure \u2018there and back again.\u2019",

There his family dwells in peace and comfort: his proud wife, Catelyn; his sons Robb, Brandon, and Rickon; his daughters Sansa and Arya; and his bastard son, Jon Snow. Far to the north, behind the towering Wall, lie savage Wildings and worse--unnatural things relegated to myth during the centuries-long summer, but proving all too real and all too deadly in the turning of the season. Yet a more immediate threat lurks to the south, where Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, has died under mysterious circumstances. Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the lovely but cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen's brothers Jaime and Tyrion of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister--the first a swordsman without equal, the second a dwarf whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind. All are heading for Winterfell and a fateful encounter that will change the course of kingdoms. Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys, heir of the fallen House Targaryen, which once ruled all of Westeros, schemes to reclaim the throne with an army of barbarian Dothraki--whose loyalty he will purchase in the only coin left to him: his beautiful yet innocent sister, Daenerys. \"Long live George Martin . . . a literary dervish, enthralled by complicated characters and vivid language, and bursting with the wild vision of the very best tale tellers.\"--The New York Times",

He steals from the rich - they're the only ones worth stealing from - but the poor can go steal for themselves. What Locke cons, wheedles and tricks into his possession is strictly for him and his band of fellow con-artists and thieves: the Gentleman Bastards. Together their domain is the city of Camorr. Built of Elderglass by a race no-one remembers, it's a city of shifting revels, filthy canals, baroque palaces and crowded cemeteries.

The tale follows the life of King Arthur, from his early days as a young, uncertain boy under the care of the wizard Merlyn to his eventual reign and the establishment of the Knights of the Round Table. White skillfully explores themes of chivalry, war, love, and the complexities of leadership, all set against the backdrop of a mythical medieval Britain. The novel's enduring appeal lies in its ability to blend adventure and introspection, offering readers a poignant examination of human nature and the pursuit of an idealized kingdom.

The series is written and show-run by Neil himself and stars David Tennant, Michael Sheen, Jon Hamm and Miranda Richardson, to name but a few. **Includes an introduction by Neil Gaiman about bringing Good Omens to the screen** Before he died in 2015, Terry Pratchett asked Neil Gaiman to make a television series of the internationally beloved novel they wrote together about the end of the world. And so, Neil began to write. And continued to write until he had six episodes that brought an angel, Aziraphale, and a demon, Crowley, (the only things standing between us and the inevitable Armageddon) to life for the screen. Contained between the covers of this book are the scripts that Neil wrote, which later turned into some of the most extraordinary television ever made.

When she is six, she goes blind, and her father builds her a model of their neighborhood, every house, every manhole, so she can memorize it with her fingers and navigate the real streets with her feet and cane. When the Germans occupy Paris, father and daughter flee to Saint-Malo on the Brittany coast, where Marie-Laure's agoraphobic great uncle lives in a tall, narrow house by the sea wall. In another world in Germany, an orphan boy, Werner, grows up with his younger sister, Jutta, both enchanted by a crude radio Werner finds. He becomes a master at building and fixing radios, a talent that wins him a place at an elite and brutal military academy and, ultimately, makes him a highly specialized tracker of the Resistance. Werner travels through the heart of Hitler Youth to the far-flung outskirts of Russia, and finally into Saint-Malo, where his path converges with Marie-Laure. Doerr's gorgeous combination of soaring imagination with observation is electric. Deftly interweaving the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner, Doerr illuminates the ways, against all odds, people try to be good to one another. Ten years in the writing, All the Light We Cannot See is his most ambitious and dazzling work\"--",

The only relief from the sea of logos is within the autonomous city-states, where law-abiding citizens don\u2019t dare leave their mansions. Hiro delivers pizza to the mansions for a living, defending his pies from marauders when necessary with a matched set of samurai swords. His home is a shared 20 X 30 U-Stor-It. He spends most of his time goggled in to the Metaverse, where his avatar is legendary. But in the club known as The Black Sun, his fellow hackers are being felled by a weird new drug called Snow Crash that reduces them to nothing more than a jittering cloud of bad digital karma (and IRL, a vegetative state). Investigating the Infocalypse leads Hiro all the way back to the beginning of language itself, with roots in an ancient Sumerian priesthood. He\u2019ll be joined by Y.T., a fearless teenaged skateboard courier. Together, they must race to stop a shadowy virtual villain hell-bent on world domination.",

One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi\u2019s transformation from a na\u00efve medical student \u201cpossessed,\u201d as he wrote, \u201cby the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life\u201d into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. \u201cI began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSeven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: \u2018I can\u2019t go on.

If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. Instead, the issue is with your system. There is a reason bad habits repeat themselves over and over again, it's not that you are not willing to change, but that you have the wrong system for changing. \u201cYou do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems\u201d - James Clear I\u2019m a huge fan of this book, and as soon as I read it I knew it was going to make a big difference in my life, so I couldn\u2019t wait to make a video on this book and share my ideas. Here is a link to James Clear\u2019s website, where I found he uploads a tonne of useful posts on motivation, habit formation and human psychology.

        "description": "From New York Times bestseller author Mark Manson, comes an irreverent, interactive journal based on the internationally bestselling phenomenon The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck and the New York Times bestseller Everything is F*cked, providing questions and sharp insights in his inimitable voice. In classic Mark Manson style, this journal isn't a \"once a day\" or \"once a week\" thing. You can use it any time. Or not. Leave it and come back. Or not. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck Journal is divided into five sections that mirror the themes of The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck and include guided prompts that help you consider the deepest questions around emotions, values and purpose. Manson's wisdom is complimented with exercises to make you laugh, think, and grow, and his in-your-face attitude is only matched by his sincerity in wanting you to really wrestle with yourself and the things that matter. When it comes to the big topics--things like happiness, values, and responsibility--life is punctuated by seemingly endless questions. Manson addresses these issues with his unique irreverence, offering insights and observations to help you find your own answers. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck Journal provides ample space for contemplating life's ups and downs and guides you to see how key moments in your life--both the tragic and the comic--are opportunities for growth (and sometimes just a good laugh). The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck Journal is illustrated with color images throughout.",

        "description": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 Bren\u00e9 Brown has taught us what it means to dare greatly, rise strong, and brave the wilderness. Now, based on new research conducted with leaders, change makers, and culture shifters, she\u2019s showing us how to put those ideas into practice so we can step up and lead. Don\u2019t miss the five-part HBO Max docuseries Bren\u00e9 Brown: Atlas of the Heart! NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY BLOOMBERG Leadership is not about titles, status, and wielding power. A leader is anyone who takes responsibility for recognizing the potential in people and ideas, and has the courage to develop that potential. When we dare to lead, we don\u2019t pretend to have the right answers; we stay curious and ask the right questions. We don\u2019t see power as finite and hoard it; we know that power becomes infinite when we share it with others. We don\u2019t avoid difficult conversations and situations; we lean into vulnerability when it\u2019s necessary to do good work. But daring leadership in a culture defined by scarcity, fear, and uncertainty requires skill-building around traits that are deeply and uniquely human. The irony is that we\u2019re choosing not to invest in developing the hearts and minds of leaders at the exact same time as we\u2019re scrambling to figure out what we have to offer that machines and AI can\u2019t do better and faster. What can we do better? Empathy, connection, and courage, to start. Four-time #1 New York Times bestselling author Bren\u00e9 Brown has spent the past two decades studying the emotions and experiences that give meaning to our lives, and the past seven years working with transformative leaders and teams spanning the globe. She found that leaders in organizations ranging from small entrepreneurial startups and family-owned businesses to nonprofits, civic organizations, and Fortune 50 companies all ask the same question: How do you cultivate braver, more daring leaders, and how do you embed the value of courage in your culture? In this new book, Brown uses research, stories, and examples to answer these questions in the no-BS style that millions of readers have come to expect and love. Brown writes, \u201cOne of the most important findings of my career is that daring leadership is a collection of four skill sets that are 100 percent teachable, observable, and measurable. It\u2019s learning and unlearning that requires brave work, tough conversations, and showing up with your whole heart. Easy? No. Because choosing courage over comfort is not always our default. Worth it? Always. We want to be brave with our lives and our work. It\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d Whether you\u2019ve read Daring Greatly and Rising Strong or you\u2019re new to Bren\u00e9 Brown\u2019s work, this book is for anyone who wants to step up and into brave leadership.",

And while he's not the biggest geek in the school, he is by no means popular. Shy, introspective, intelligent beyond his years yet socially awkward, he is a wallflower, caught between trying to live his life and trying to run from it. Charlie is attempting to navigate his way through uncharted territory: the world of first dates and mix-tapes, family dramas and new friends; the world of sex, drugs, and The Rocky Horror Picture Show, when all one requires is that perfect song on that perfect drive to feel infinite. But Charlie can't stay on the sideline forever. Standing on the fringes of life offers a unique perspective. But there comes a time to see what it looks like from the dance floor.

Eleanor of Aquitaine (1124-1204) is one of the most important and well-known figures of the Middle Ages; she exercised a huge influence on both the course of history, and on the cultural life, of the time. The essays in this collection use her as a point of entry into wider-ranging discussions of the literary, social, political and religious milieux into which she was born, and to which she contributed; they address many of the misconceptions that have grown around both Eleanor herself and the medieval Midi in general, and open up new areas of debate. Topics explored include the work of the troubadours and the importance to them of patronage; perceptions of southern France and itsinhabitants by outsiders; the early history of the Templars in southern France; cultural contacts between the Midi and other parts of the Latin world; the uses of ritual and historical myth in the expression of political power; and attitudes towards women.
